1. Explain the importance of groundwater in water supply, agriculture, ecosystems, and engineering applications.
2. Describe the hydrologic cycle and groundwater’s role within surface–subsurface water interactions.
3. Apply the hydrologic (water budget) equation to steady-state and transient systems.
4. Identify major groundwater challenges, including depletion, contamination, and sustainability under climate change.
5. Recognize sources and impacts of groundwater contamination and the basic principles of remediation.

# Module 2: Properties of Aquifers 

1. Define and quantify key aquifer properties including porosity, specific yield, hydraulic conductivity, transmissivity, and storativity.
2. Apply Darcy’s Law to analyze groundwater flow and perform first-order calculations.
3. Differentiate aquifer types and storage mechanisms in confined and unconfined systems.
4. Evaluate spatial variability in hydraulic properties, including heterogeneity, anisotropy, and hydraulic gradient variation.

# Module 3: Principles of Groundwater Flow 

1. Define and interpret hydraulic head as mechanical energy per unit weight and determine groundwater flow direction from head gradients.
2. Measure and analyze hydraulic head data to compute horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients.
3. Formulate and solve groundwater flow equations for confined and unconfined aquifers under steady-state conditions.
4. Construct and interpret flow nets to estimate groundwater flow patterns and discharge.

# Module 4: Well Hydraulics 

1. Explain aquifer response to pumping under steady and transient radial flow conditions.
2. Apply analytical solutions (Thiem, Theis, Cooper–Jacob, Neuman) to estimate transmissivity and storativity.
3. Analyze pumping test data using graphical and regression methods.
4. Design and interpret aquifer tests, accounting for well losses, boundaries, heterogeneity, and sustainability implications.

# Module 5: Field Methods 

1. Explain the principles of electrical resistivity imaging and its relationship to hydraulic conductivity and subsurface lithology.
2. Interpret geophysical well logs (resistivity, SP, gamma ray) to distinguish sand and clay formations.
3. Integrate geophysical and pumping test data to characterize aquifer properties.
4. Develop a conceptual hydrogeologic model to support groundwater flow modeling and management decisions.

# Module 6: Groundwater Flow Modeling 

1. Develop a conceptual model of a groundwater system based on site data and hydrogeologic understanding.
2. Translate a conceptual model into a numerical model using MODFLOW, including discretization and boundary conditions.
3. Calibrate a groundwater flow model using manual and automated parameter estimation (e.g., PEST).
4. Evaluate model performance and uncertainty using residual analysis, objective functions, and sensitivity concepts.
5. Apply a calibrated model for engineering decision-making, including pumping design, capture zone delineation, and remediation planning.

# Module 7: Solute Transport (Contaminant Transport) 

1. Describe the main transport processes in groundwater: advection, dispersion, diffusion, sorption, and transformation.
2. Define and compute key transport parameters, including seepage velocity, dispersion coefficient, and retardation factor.
3. Differentiate linear and non-linear sorption and explain their effects on plume behavior and breakthrough curves.
4. Formulate and apply the 1D advection–dispersion equation (ADE) under specified initial and boundary conditions.
5. Use analytical solutions of the ADE to predict contaminant concentrations in time and space.
