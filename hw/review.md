# Paper Review

## Assignment  objectives

In this reading assignment, each student is required to review and present one paper. The instructor provided several journal papers and USGS technical reports on Canvas. You need to select one of the provided papers to review. If you want to review a paper that is not on this list, you need the instructor's approval. You do not need the instructor's approval for a USGS technical report, or for a research or review paper from a Q1 journal or any of the following journals:

- Advances in Water Resources (AWR)
- Environmental Modelling & Software (EMS) 
- Environmental Research Letters (ERL)
- Earth's Future - AGU Journal 
- Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) - AGU Journal 
- Hydrogeology Journal
- Hydrology and Earth System Sciences (HESS) - EGU Journal
- Journal of Contaminant Hydrology
- Journal of Hydrology (JoH) 
- Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies
- Nature Water 
- Water Resources Research (WRR) - AGU Journal 

It goes without saying, the paper must contain a groundwater component.

These papers present topics beyond what we covered in class to help you to learn on our own using the basic principles that you learned in the class. You will review the paper and prepare a 30-minute presentation to the class. The presentation should include three components.

First, you should present the characteristics of the dataset presented in the paper, objectives and hypotheses of the analysis, and analytical and numerical tools used to carry out the work presented in the paper.
Second, you should express an opinion about whether you found the paper easy or hard to read, whether you consider the results (or the method if the authors are presenting a novel method) important, and whether you agree with the authors on their conclusions.
Third, you should clearly discuss with the class the topics that you still need to learn and the training that you need to get to replicate and build-on the work that you reviewed. 

You do NOT have to recite theory or copy formulas except to the extent that is necessary to answer abovementioned questions. The objectives of this reading assignment is to challenge you, stretch your mental capabilities, and display the applications of what we covered in the class. It also helps you to decide on what you want to learn next.

## Presentation Rubric

The paper review counts as 10% toward your final grade.  You do not need to submit a review report. Your grade will be based on your presentation. Prepare you presentation to give room for at least one question. Note, to have good figure legibility, you can download the figure from the web version of the paper (instead of using the image capture feature in the pdf software).
