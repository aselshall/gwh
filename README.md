## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental principles of groundwater flow and solute transport in aquifers, emphasizing interactions between groundwater and the environment. Students will gain hands-on experience with basic groundwater modeling using the industry-standard tool MODFLOW, providing a foundation for further study and careers in water resources management.

## Introduction

Groundwater flows beneath the Earth's surface through pores, fractures, and conduits within aquifers—water-saturated soil and rock formations that transmit significant quantities of water. Groundwater is the Earth's largest non-frozen freshwater reservoir, accounting for more than 97% of liquid freshwater. It is the world's most extracted natural resource, with withdrawal rates around 1000 km³/year. Groundwater is a reliable freshwater source, moving slowly through aquifers and providing vital benefits to billions of people. It supplies over half of the drinking water, approximately 40% of irrigation water, and about one-third of freshwater for industrial activities. Groundwater also supports ecosystems in aquifers, soils, rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal zones, and marine environments, offering numerous ecosystem services. Additionally, groundwater is a geothermal energy resource and plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, such as carbon sequestration in deep saline aquifers and flood-managed aquifer recharge.

Groundwater in Florida is especially critical, serving as the primary source of drinking water for nearly 90% of the state's population. The state relies heavily on the Floridan Aquifer, one of the most productive in the world, which supplies water not only for Florida but also for parts of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. This aquifer supports significant agricultural and industrial activities, with its porous limestone formations. Groundwater in Florida also sustains the state's unique ecosystems, including springs, rivers, and wetlands that are home to diverse flora and fauna. The interaction between groundwater and surface water is vital for maintaining the health of these ecosystems and protecting against saltwater intrusion in coastal areas. However, Florida's groundwater faces numerous challenges, including contamination from agricultural runoff, over-extraction, and the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels. Effective groundwater management and conservation are essential for ensuring sustainable water resources for the state's growing population and economy, as well as for preserving its natural environments for future generations.

This course serves as an introduction to groundwater hydrology, covering elements of the hydrologic cycle and various topics related to groundwater availability. Key topics include aquifer properties, principles of groundwater flow and solute transport, and groundwater pumping. The course also briefly introduces soil moisture and groundwater recharge, surface water-groundwater interaction, and natural environments of groundwater occurrence. Applied groundwater modeling is included. This course is valuable not only for students pursuing a career in groundwater hydrology, but also for those interested in environmental and water resources management. It is a prerequisite for courses in contaminant hydrogeology, groundwater modeling, environmental geophysics, and integrated water resources management.

## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply the principles of the water cycle to calculate the mass balance of groundwater aquifers and surface water bodies
- Analyze laboratory and field data to determine properties of groundwater aquifers, including hydraulic conductivity
- Describe the directions and magnitudes of groundwater flow using fundamental principles of groundwater flow
- Understand the interactions among hydrological, geological, and transport processes affecting groundwater systems
- Develop and calibrate a basic groundwater model to simulate groundwater flow and evaluate different groundwater management strategies

### Assessment Plan (100%)

- Participation – 10%  
- Homework – 30%  
- Midterm – 30%  
- Project – 20%  
- Paper Review – 10%

### General Notes

- Grades Due from Faculty by Noon - Fall 2025 (Full Term)	Tuesday, 16 December 2025
- If you are falling behind, consult the academic calendar for the last day to drop.
- Incomplete grades are granted in exceptional circumstances (e.g., medical emergency)

## Participation

For participation assessment, students are expected to:
- Watch recorded videos and fill-out exit tickets and [participation log](https://aselshall.github.io/gwh/hw/participation)
- Complete the survey at the end of each module meaningfully to provide instructor with constructive feedback and suggestions

These form the majority of your participation grade.  

## Homework
A weekly homework will be posted on Canvas. Each assignment is due by Sunday at 11:59 pm, unless otherwise posted on CANVAS. Few assignments are designed to include self-directed learning opportunities. This is to give you the opportunity to explore and experiment with engineering problems of your interest.

### Late Homework Policy
- If you encounter challenges that may affect your ability to submit on time, please communicate with the instructor as early as possible to explore possible accommodations.
- Deadline maybe extended for [execused absences](#Execused-Absence-Policy)
- Unexecused late submissions received after the deadline will incur a penalty of 20% per day of the total possible points
- Once the solutions and grades are posted, late unexecused submissions will not be accepted, and a score of zero will be assigned

## Exam
- A comprehensive midterm exam will be conducted online.
- You will have 24 hours to complete the exam, which will include approximately 10 multiple-choice questions testing qualitative understanding, and about five problems focused on problem-solving.  
- Study guide: If you can solve the exercises, practice problems, and homework assignments, you will be well-prepared for the exam.  
- A makeup exam may be provided for students with an [excused absence](#excused-absence-policy).

## Execused Absence Policy
- Absence excuse requires written documentation from a certified medical professional, faculty member, administration, coach, or athletic director.
- Absence will be execused after the verification of the submitted document
- Any attempt to falsify documents will be taken very seriously in accordance with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf)

## Policy for Academic Integrity Violations 
- Academic dishonesty in assignments, projects, or exams will result in a grade of zero for that submission, and will be strictly addressed in line with [FGCU policies and procedures](https://fgcucdn.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/files/academic_integrity_flowchart_2019.pdf).
- Familiarize yourself with the [FGCU Student Guidebook](https://www.fgcu.edu/studentlife/studentconduct/) that outlines the consequences for academic integrity violations.

## Financial Aid Statement

As of fall 2015, all faculty members are required to use Canvas to confirm a student's attendance for each course by the end of the first week of classes. Failure to do so will result in a delay in the disbursement of your financial aid. The confirmation of attendance is required for all students, not only those receiving financial aid.

## Generative AI Use

Generative AI including large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gimini, Claude, and DeepL should not be used in assignments and exams unless indicated by the text "Generative AI Permitted". Students must cite the used generative AI tool, and failing to do so will be considered academic dishonesty. Check FGCU Generative AI policy for more details.

## Core Syllabus Policies 

FGCU has a set of central policies related to student recording class sessions, academic integrity and grievances, student accessibility services, academic disruption, generative AI, and religious observances that apply to all courses at FGCU.
