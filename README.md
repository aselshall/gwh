## Introduction

Groundwater flows beneath the Earth's surface through pores, fractures, and conduits within aquifers—water-saturated soil and rock formations that transmit significant quantities of water. Groundwater is the Earth's largest non-frozen freshwater reservoir, accounting for more than 97% of liquid freshwater. It is the world's most extracted natural resource, with withdrawal rates around 1000 km³/year. Groundwater is a reliable freshwater source, moving slowly through aquifers and providing vital benefits to billions of people. It supplies over half of the drinking water, approximately 40% of irrigation water, and about one-third of freshwater for industrial activities. Groundwater also supports ecosystems in aquifers, soils, rivers, lakes, wetlands, coastal zones, and marine environments, offering numerous ecosystem services. Additionally, groundwater is a geothermal energy resource and plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, such as carbon sequestration in deep saline aquifers and flood-managed aquifer recharge.

Groundwater in Florida is especially critical, serving as the primary source of drinking water for nearly 90% of the state's population. The state relies heavily on the Floridan Aquifer, one of the most productive in the world, which supplies water not only for Florida but also for parts of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. This aquifer supports significant agricultural and industrial activities, with its porous limestone formations. Groundwater in Florida also sustains the state's unique ecosystems, including springs, rivers, and wetlands that are home to diverse flora and fauna. The interaction between groundwater and surface water is vital for maintaining the health of these ecosystems and protecting against saltwater intrusion in coastal areas. However, Florida's groundwater faces numerous challenges, including contamination from agricultural runoff, over-extraction, and the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels. Effective groundwater management and conservation are essential for ensuring sustainable water resources for the state's growing population and economy, as well as for preserving its natural environments for future generations.

This course serves as an introduction to groundwater hydrology, covering elements of the hydrologic cycle and various topics related to groundwater availability. Key topics include aquifer properties, principles of groundwater flow and solute transport, and groundwater pumping. The course also briefly introduces soil moisture and groundwater recharge, surface water-groundwater interaction, and natural environments of groundwater occurrence. Applied groundwater modeling is included. This course is valuable not only for students pursuing a career in groundwater hydrology, but also for those interested in environmental and water resources management. It is a prerequisite for courses in contaminant hydrogeology, groundwater modeling, environmental geophysics, and integrated water resources management.
