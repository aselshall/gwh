The Surface Water-Groundwater Field Lab supports both field-based research and hands-on teaching. The lab consists of a growing suite of deployable instruments for performing laboratory-grade analysis in natural environments. Our measurement capabilities are used to investigate the critical zone where surface water and groundwater meet, as well as broader groundwater resources. This includes 
- High-resolution water quality analysis
- Near-real-time water budget calculations
- Hydraulic measurements
- Subsurface imaging using hydrogeophysical methods 

By bringing these analytical tools to the field, we advance understanding and develop solutions for hydrological and environmental systems. These systems include: 
- Interaction between surface water-groundwater systems and coastal estuaries
- [Sustainability of vital groundwater aquifers and climate resilience](https://mewcha1.github.io/NBI)
- [Fate and transport of pesticides and nutrients from agricultural areas in south florida](https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~mye/Pesticides.php)
- Sustainable agricultural inputs to improve crop productivity and reduce environmental impacts
