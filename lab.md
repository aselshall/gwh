# Surface water-groundwater field lab

The Surface Water-Groundwater Field Lab supports both field-based research and hands-on teaching. The lab consists of a comprehensive suite of deployable instruments designed for performing laboratory-grade analysis in natural environments. Our measurement capabilities are used to investigate the critical zone where surface water and groundwater meet, as well as broader groundwater resources. This includes high-resolution water quality analysis, near-real-time water budget calculations, hydraulic measurements, subsurface imaging using hydrogeophysical methods like Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). By bringing these advanced analytical tools to the field, we advance scientific understanding of and develop solutions for complex hydrological and environmental systems. These include interplay between surface water-groundwater systems and coastal estuaries, the sustainability of vital groundwater aquifers,  [the fate and transport of nutrients and pesticides from agricultural watersheds in south florida](https://atmos.eoas.fsu.edu/~mye/Pesticides.php), and developing sustainable agricultural inputs to improve crop productivity and reduce environmental impacts. 

## Water quality measurements

### [YSI ProSample P-12](https://www.ysi.com/prosample)
It is a full-size portable sampler with SDI-12 connectivity, designed for automatic water sampling. It comes with distributor arms to hold (24) 1L bottles, an SDI-12 cable for device
connectivity, and a set of (24) 1L polyethylene bottles with lids for sample storage. It comes
with a battery charger (IP-67) waterproof and CEC compliant, suitable for charging
equipment batteries in the field.
● YSI EXO2 Sonde (https://www.ysi.com/exo2)
It is a multiparameter water quality sonde with six sensor ports, capable of 250 m depth
measurements, and includes accessories like batteries, a calibration cup, and a tool kit.
Accompanying the sonde are various sensors: the Conductivity/Temperature Sensor with
anti-fouling capabilities, the Optical DO Sensor with a titanium housing for dissolved oxygen
measurement, and the pH & ORP Smart Sensor for measuring pH and oxidation-reduction
potential.
